angular-syscoin
==========

AngularJS service to support communicating with the daemon through the new builtin HTTP proxy server.

This project is extremely bare bones at the moment. It doesn't have a package.json or any other dependency 
requirements that it may very well need. Its primary purpose it to be the single, most up to date version of
the angularJS syscoinService currently available.

You may need to modify dependency injections as needed in the module declaration for it to work with your
angular application.
